## User interaction

When running `main.py` the program initializes prompt dialogue with the user.
\
From there the user can choose what difficulty he wants to play at.
\
If the input is incorrect the game will not start and the user will be asked to type the difficulty again.
\
After choosing level difficulty a game window is open in the taskbar.
\
At the beginning of the map a "Guide" is spawned explain how the game works.
\
If the player drops off the map the game is over and the player has to run the code again.
\
The level is finished if the second "Guide" is reached.
